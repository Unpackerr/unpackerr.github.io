Unpackerr requires write access to your download location.
Make sure you set the `path` variables correctly in the configuration.
Even if they're set incorrectly Unpackerr makes a best effort attempt
to locate your downloads. If it can't find your downloads, then the
`path` or `paths` variables need to be adjusted.
