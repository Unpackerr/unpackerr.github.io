[edit this page](https://github.com/Unpackerr/unpackerr.github.io/blob/main/docs/downloaders/usenet.md).

This is what causes sab to unpack the files instead of unpackerr.
Select an option that is not `default` nor `+unpack`.

[See more on this topic](https://github.com/Unpackerr/unpackerr/issues/285).
