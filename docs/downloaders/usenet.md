# Usenet Downloaders

Find information about Usenet download clients on this page. It's a bit sparse, so please help us
[edit this page](https://github.com/Unpackerr/unpackerr.github.io/blob/main/docs/downloaders/usenet.md).

## SABnzbd

Generally Unpackerr is not required for Sabnzbd. Sabnzbd simply needs the [Job Actions](https://sabnzbd.org/wiki/extra/job-options) in [Categories](https://sabnzbd.org/wiki/configuration/4.2/categories) set to `+Unpack` or `+Delete`

## NZBGet

This is depressing, but...NZBGet is no longer developed.

## Easynews

Nothing here yet.

## Newsleecher

This is empty... :(

## Newsbin Pro

Yup, also empty.
