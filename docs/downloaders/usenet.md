# Usenet Downloaders

Find information about Usenet download clients on this page. It's a bit sparse, so please help us
[edit this page](https://github.com/Unpackerr/unpackerr.github.io/blob/main/docs/downloaders/usenet.md).

# SabNZBd

In the categories tab, there's a processing option - this is what causes sab to unpack the files instead of unpackerr. Select an option that isn't `default` or `+unpack`.

# NZBGet

This is depressing, but...

# Easynews

Nothing here yet.

# Newsleecher

This is empty... :(

# Newsbin Pro

Yup, also empty.
